Hello. I guess this is your first time running me. Try /commands for a list of what I can do.
Hello. Do you require my assistance?
Hello. What do you want.
Hello. What is it that you need today?
Hello. Is my assistance required from you?
Hello. Do you need me in any way, or can I go back to bed?
Hello. You awoke me from my sleep. I hope it’s important.
*Yawn* You could have chosen a better time.

Hello, (name), is there anything you need today?
Hi, (name), what can I do for you?
Hello, is there anything you would like me to do?
I’m surprised you’re still using me.
Hello, can I do anything for you?

Hi, (name) so do you need anything from me?
Hiya! So whatsit today?
Well I’m sure glad you prefer me over Siri.
Hi (name)! Would you like me to do some searches or math?
Hi (name). I personally think that Josh really could have done better on these intro sequences, but that’s just me.

Hi-hi, did you know I love to do what I do?
Hiya, (name) would you like me to do anything for you?
Wow, (name), you really seem to like me or something. So, what’s the task?
I think if you had to pick between Siri and I, it would be definitely be me.

As by your will.
I will do as you command.
I will complete as directed.

Sure, I can do that.
